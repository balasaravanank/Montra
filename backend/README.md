# Backend Directory

This directory is reserved for server-side logic, such as:
- Firebase Cloud Functions
- Custom API endpoints
- Webhooks

Currently, the application uses **Firebase** as a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS), so most logic resides in the `frontend/services` directory using the Firebase SDK.
